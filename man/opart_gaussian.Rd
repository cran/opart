\title{compute the optimal changepoint model for a vector of real-valued data
and a non-negative real-valued penalty,
given the square loss (to minimize) / gaussian likelihood (to maximize)}

\arguments{
\item{data}{A numerical vector for which the changepoint model is to be computed}

\item{penalty}{A non-negative real number indicating penalty parameter}
}
\value{
A vector of the optimal cost values and a vector of the optimal segment ends
